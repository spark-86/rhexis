# Rhexis - Computational Reality Engine

Rhexis is an emergent-compute engine that treats computation the way physics treats events: as interactions between entities, states, and transformations that exist because the surrounding conditions allow them to. Instead of imperative programs or static apps, Rhexis builds reality-like systems where behavior arises from flux, schemas, and transforms responding to one another.
The engine runs on a universal substrate—Flux—that holds all state as discrete, typed items. Transforms (verbs) observe, consume, and emit Flux in deterministic cycles, allowing complex behavior to emerge from simple rules. Rhexis kernels replay, fork, and synchronize these worlds across devices, building a deterministic lattice of computational “reality.”
Key ideas:
Flux: Structured, discoverable state objects that model “what exists right now.”
Transforms: Declarative behaviors that fire when conditions in Flux become true.
Membranes: Environment-specific shims that bootstrap a device into the lattice, load capabilities, and express hardware differences without fracturing the engine.
Deterministic Kernel: Hashes the entire world each cycle using BLAKE3, guaranteeing replayability, auditability, and cross-node alignment.
Lattice: A shared, sidereal-time-anchored computational fabric where realities sync, state persists, and computation becomes near-zero-cost at rest.
The result is a computing model that feels less like running code and more like stepping into a physics engine that shapes itself around user intent. Rhexis becomes the connective tissue for distributed compute, identity, simulation, and interaction—an engine where “apps” dissolve into capabilities that assemble themselves around what the user wants to do.
Rhexis is the backbone of the broader Cryptophysics architecture and the bridge between classical computing and emergent, reality-driven computation.
