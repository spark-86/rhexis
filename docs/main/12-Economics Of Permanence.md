# 12. Economics of Permanence

## Abstract

When deletion is impossible and provenance is perfect, the foundations of economics change. Scarcity, value, and incentive—traditionally managed by institutions and enforced by mutable ledgers—become physical properties of a causal universe. In the Computational Reality Engine (CRE), economic activity is a flow of conserved quantities across SigilID worldlines, constrained by irreversible history and cryptographic law. This chapter develops ledger‑native economics, introduces **micromarks as units of time** and **vints as atomic units of value**, and derives the conditions under which post‑scarcity coordination becomes stable rather than chaotic.

## 12.1 From Mutable Ledgers to Conserved History

Classical economies rely on records that can be altered, erased, or reinterpreted. Trust is therefore external: auditors, courts, regulators, and force. In CRE, records are immutable and causally ordered. Ownership, transfer, and obligation are not conventions; they are topological features of spacetime.

An asset is not a row in a database. It is a worldline of custody.

---

## 12.2 Scarcity as Causal Constraint

Scarcity arises when multiple SigilIDs desire to couple to the same conserved resource worldline. Because records cannot be duplicated without violating conservation laws, double‑spend and counterfeit are unphysical. Scarcity is thus not enforced by policing; it is enforced by geometry.

---

## 12.3 Value as Potential Energy

Value is the capacity of a record to enable future transformations. In field terms, it is potential energy. A token, a right, or a claim has value to the extent that it can relax constraints or open new causal trajectories.

---

## 12.4 Micromarks: Atomic Time Quanta

Micromarks are the smallest practical quanta of **time accounting** in CRE. They measure duration, scheduling commitments, and temporal coupling between causal events. Micromarks are not money. They are the unit by which the cost of waiting, the latency of action, and the binding of futures are expressed and compared.

Micromarks enable:

* Deterministic temporal accounting without drift,
* Verifiable deadlines and service guarantees as records,
* Comparable time‑costs across transforms, HPC calls, and governance processes.

Time is not value in CRE—but time is a conserved constraint, and micromarks make it legible.

---

## 12.5 Vints: Atomic Economic Quanta

Vints are the atomic economic unit of CRE: the smallest indivisible quantum of ledger‑native value. Where micromarks measure **duration**, vints measure **economic capacity**—transferable, conserved, and provable by provenance.

Vints allow:

* Exact accounting without rounding drift,
* Deterministic settlement,
* Composable exchange across domains (energy, compute, logistics, labor) via explicit transforms.

## 12.6 Ledger‑Native Money

Money in CRE is not fiat or promise; it is a conserved causal token whose provenance and constraints are intrinsic. Issuance is a transform; circulation is a field flow; destruction is impossible—only sequestration or supersession.

Inflation and deflation correspond to changes in field density, not arbitrary policy.

---

## 12.7 Ownership as Worldline Coupling

To own is to be the authorized continuation of a resource’s worldline. Transfer is the lawful re‑binding of that worldline to a new SigilID. Theft would require a break in causal ancestry and is therefore detectable and non‑resonant with lawful transforms.

---

## 12.8 Markets as Reaction Networks

A market is a reaction network in the flux field. Bids and asks are potentials; trades are interaction vertices; prices are equilibrium points where opposing gradients cancel.

Arbitrage is the flow of conserved quantity from high‑potential to low‑potential regions.

---

## 12.9 Time, Interest, and Entropy

Interest is compensation for temporal coupling: the willingness to delay one’s own causal extension (measured in micromarks) in exchange for future economic potential (measured in vints). Entropy grows as commitments accumulate and options close. Discounting is the geometry of shrinking future light‑cones.

---

## 12.10 Credit and Obligation

Credit is a forward‑directed causal promise: a signed record that authorizes future claims denominated in vints and bounded by micromark horizons. Default is not a moral failure; it is a topological rupture that constrains future authority and propagates through trust fields.

---

## 12.11 Labor as Transform Application

Labor is the application of lawful transforms that convert low‑order resources into higher‑order structures. Its value is measured by the irreversible increase in causal complexity it produces and the vints such complexity commands.

---

## 12.12 Automation and Abundance

As HPCs and transforms reduce the micromark time cost of production toward zero, classical scarcity collapses. However, coordination costs remain. The economic problem shifts from allocation of goods to allocation of *attention, trust, and consent*.

---

## 12.13 Post‑Scarcity Does Not Mean Post‑Economics

In a post‑scarcity regime, material constraints loosen but causal constraints remain. Conflicts move from objects to trajectories: whose future is coupled to which system, and under what law.

---

## 12.14 Universal Accounting and Transparency

Because every transfer, obligation, and temporal commitment is a record, shadow economies become visible as anomalous energy and time flows. Corruption appears as unexplained gradients; rent‑seeking as persistent potential wells without productive output.

---

## 12.15 Commons and Tragedy Prevention

Commons fail when depletion is invisible and unaccountable. In CRE, depletion is a recorded event with conserved consequences. Overuse raises potential barriers automatically, enforcing sustainable equilibrium.

---

## 12.16 Redistribution as Field Rebalancing

Redistribution is not moral fiat; it is the adjustment of value density (vints) and time pressure (micromarks) to prevent runaway gradients that destabilize the system. Transfers are lawful relaxation processes, not charity.

---

## 12.17 Incentives as Gradient Shaping

Incentives shape the potential landscape so that beneficial actions correspond to downhill paths in both value and time. Poorly designed incentives create false minima; well‑designed ones align local descent with global stability.

---

## 12.18 Energy, Compute, and Value Convergence

As energy production, computation, and logistics become fully ledger‑integrated, their accounting unifies. A joule, a CPU‑cycle, and a kilometer of transport become exchangeable through conserved vint transforms and bounded by micromark costs.

---

## 12.19 Inter‑Scope Economics

Different scopes may operate with distinct currencies and constraints, but cross‑scope trade is mediated by exchange transforms that preserve global conservation while respecting local law.

---

## 12.20 The End of Monetary Illusion

Speculation detached from causal production creates unstable oscillations. In CRE, every claim must anchor to a productive lineage and an auditable time cost or collapse under forensic analysis. Bubbles become topologically unsustainable.

---

## 12.21 Conclusion: Wealth as Causal Capacity

In the Computational Reality Engine, wealth is not possession but potential—the capacity, measured in vints and bounded by micromarks, to lawfully shape future spacetime. Scarcity is constraint geometry, value is potential energy, and incentive is gradient. With immutable history and perfect provenance, economics becomes a branch of physics: the study of how conserved causal capacity and conserved time flow, accumulate, and equilibrate in a universe where nothing that has happened can ever be undone.
