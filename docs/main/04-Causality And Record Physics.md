# 4. Causality and Record Physics

## Abstract

This chapter formalizes the physics of causation in the Computational Reality Engine (CRE). Every record carries ancestry; every transformation declares its parents. Hash chains, signatures, and scopes together define a directed, cryptographically provable causal graph. From this graph emerge light‑cones of computational influence, conservation laws for truth and authorship, and hard limits that prevent paradox, rollback, and forged history. We develop the geometry, invariants, and dynamics of this record spacetime, and show how computation becomes a lawful propagation of cause and effect.

## 4.1 From Logs to Lineage

Classical systems treat logs as auxiliary artifacts—best‑effort traces of what happened. In CRE, lineage is primary. A record is not merely appended; it is *born* from explicit parents whose hashes are embedded in its body. The act of creation asserts: these causes precede me, and without them I could not exist.

This is the foundational move from narrative to physics: causality is not reconstructed; it is declared and verified.

---

## 4.2 The Causal Graph

The set of all records and their parent references forms a directed acyclic graph (DAG):

* **Vertices:** Records.
* **Edges:** Cryptographic parent links.
* **Direction:** From cause to effect.

Acyclicity is enforced by time and hash commitment. A record cannot reference a future hash; therefore closed timelike curves are topologically impossible.

---

## 4.3 Hash Chains as Temporal Bonds

Hash pointers bind effects to causes with irreversible commitment. To alter a cause is to change its hash; to change its hash is to invalidate every descendant. Thus:

* The past is tamper‑evident.
* The future is contingent upon the exact past that produced it.

Hash chains function as temporal bonds, analogous to conservation constraints in physical interactions.

---

## 4.4 Signatures and Authorship Fields

Every record is signed. The signature is not metadata; it is a force that anchors agency to events. Authorship becomes a vector field over the causal graph, tracing which identities injected which causes into spacetime.

Forgery requires violating cryptographic law, not merely social convention.

---

## 4.5 Scopes as Reference Frames

Scopes define domains of authority and interpretation. They partition the causal graph into regions with local laws while remaining embedded in the global lattice. A scope is a coordinate chart on spacetime: it does not create reality, but it defines how reality is named and constrained.

---

## 4.6 Light‑Cones of Influence

For any record R:

* **Past Light‑Cone:** All ancestors reachable by parent links.
* **Future Light‑Cone:** All descendants that (transitively) reference R.

Transforms may only depend on information within their past light‑cone. This enforces causal locality and prevents non‑local influence.

---

## 4.7 Paradox Prohibition

Three classical paradoxes are structurally forbidden:

1. **Retrocausation:** An effect cannot alter its own causes; hashes fix ancestry.
2. **Rollback:** History cannot be rewritten; supersession adds, never removes.
3. **Forgery of Origin:** Signatures bind events to keys and scopes; false parentage is detectable.

Paradox is not resolved by policy; it is excluded by topology.

---

## 4.8 Supersession and Causal Override

Supersession introduces new records that constrain or negate the *interpretation* of earlier ones without erasing them. In the graph, this is not deletion but the addition of higher‑order edges that bound future propagation. Error correction becomes a lawful redirection of causal flow.

---

## 4.9 Transforms as Interaction Vertices

A transform consumes patterns of records and emits new ones. In the graph, it is a local interaction where multiple worldlines intersect and produce a new event. Parent sets define the interaction’s input cone; emitted records define its output cone.

---

## 4.10 Conservation Laws

CRE exhibits conservation principles:

* **Conservation of Existence:** Events, once created, persist.
* **Conservation of Order:** Ancestry is invariant.
* **Conservation of Authorship:** Signatures remain attached to their effects.

These are not axioms; they are consequences of hash and signature mechanics.

---

## 4.11 Causal Density and Granularity

The resolution of time and interaction determines causal density. Fine‑grained transforms yield dense graphs with short light‑cones; coarse‑grained transforms yield sparse graphs with long causal strides. Both remain lawful; their difference is geometric, not ontological.

---

## 4.12 Branching and Worldline Bifurcation

When incompatible effects descend from a common past, the graph branches. Each branch carries the full ancestry up to the bifurcation and evolves independently. Branching is the natural expression of non‑deterministic choice or contested authority.

---

## 4.13 Merging and Causal Reconciliation

Merges occur when branches accept common parents in a new record, forming a shared future. Consensus protocols are thus surfaces of causal reconciliation, embedding agreement into the graph itself.

---

## 4.14 Scope Collisions and Boundary Conditions

When records from different scopes interact, boundary conditions apply. Cross‑scope references must satisfy both local authority rules and global cryptographic validity. The result is a constrained interface where causal influence can pass without violating either domain’s invariants.

---

## 4.15 Attack as Unphysical Trajectory

An attack is an attempted trajectory through causal space that violates conservation laws: forging signatures, inventing parents, or reordering time. Such trajectories cannot be embedded in the graph without detection, making security a matter of physical impossibility rather than probabilistic defense.

---

## 4.16 Causal Horizons and Finality

Finality emerges when a region of the graph becomes so densely referenced that alternative histories cannot intersect it without contradiction. This defines causal horizons beyond which rollback is not merely disallowed but topologically impossible.

---

## 4.17 Measurement and Trace Propagation

Observations are records that reference observed events, extending their future light‑cones. Measurement thus increases causal reach, much like radiation carries information forward in physical spacetime.

---

## 4.18 Formal Properties

Key properties of the causal graph:

* Directed
* Acyclic
* Cryptographically verifiable
* Scope‑partitioned
* Signature‑annotated

Together these define a rigid causal manifold.

---

## 4.19 Engineering the Graph

Practical systems implement indexing, caching, and pruning, but these are projections of the underlying graph. The physics remains invariant even as representations change.

---

## 4.20 Conclusion: Record Spacetime

In CRE, causality is not inferred; it is constructed. Hashes bind time, signatures bind agency, scopes bind law. The result is a spacetime of records where every event has a place, every cause a lineage, and every effect a provable origin. Within this record physics, computation unfolds as the lawful propagation of influence across an immutable causal manifold, making paradox, rollback, and forged history not merely forbidden, but unphysical.
