# 13. Security: Adversaries in a Law‑Bound Universe

## Abstract

In the Computational Reality Engine (CRE), security is not an arms race of patches and exploits; it is the study of what trajectories are physically admissible in a universe governed by immutable records, cryptographic signatures, and causal geometry. Attack is not about breaking software—it is about attempting to violate physics: forging ancestry, exceeding authority, reusing consumed potential, or inserting effects without causes. This chapter formalizes the threat model of a law‑bound universe, enumerates the invariants that cannot be broken, and shows how hostile transforms are constrained by the same causal contracts as honest ones. Security becomes a branch of record physics: conservation laws, horizons, and non‑resonant interactions.

## 13.1 From Perimeter Defense to Physical Law

Classical security assumes a mutable world: memory can be overwritten, logs can be erased, clocks can be spoofed, and identities can be impersonated. Defense is therefore layered: firewalls, intrusion detection, access control lists, and after‑the‑fact forensics.

CRE replaces this with a different premise: history is immutable, ancestry is provable, and authority is cryptographically bound. The attacker is not trying to slip past a guard; the attacker is trying to draw an unphysical worldline through causal spacetime.

---

## 13.2 The Adversary Model

An adversary in CRE may attempt to:

* Forge signatures or identities.
* Invent causal parents that never existed.
* Reuse consumed records (double‑spend, replay).
* Exceed scope or capability authority.
* Inject transforms that violate declared contracts.
* Exploit the membrane to introduce uncaused physical effects.

All such attempts correspond to violations of invariants, not merely policy.

---

## 13.3 Cryptographic Invariants

The foundational invariants are:

1. **Signature Unforgeability:** A record’s author cannot be falsified without breaking cryptography.
2. **Hash Ancestry:** A record’s parents cannot be altered without invalidating all descendants.
3. **Scope Authority:** A SigilID cannot lawfully act outside the scopes that recognize it.
4. **Consumption Uniqueness:** A consumed record cannot be consumed again.
5. **Temporal Order:** An effect cannot precede its cause.

These are conservation laws. Security is the study of their consequences.

## 13.4 Light‑Cone Enforcement

Every transform may reference only its past light‑cone. An adversary attempting to read or influence information outside that cone is attempting superluminal communication in causal spacetime. The lattice topology forbids such edges.

---

## 13.5 Replay and Double‑Spend

Replay attacks in classical systems exploit mutable state and idempotency gaps. In CRE, replay is lawful only as branch creation; reuse of consumed records is topologically impossible. Double‑spend is an attempt to create two future worldlines that both claim the same conserved ancestor—a violation of conservation of existence.

---

## 13.6 Hostile Transforms

A hostile transform is one whose declared contract is malicious: surveillance, coercion, resource exhaustion, or unauthorized coupling. Yet even hostile transforms are bound by the same rules:

* They must declare observes and consumes.
* They must emit signed records.
* They must respect scope and capability constraints.

They can harm only within the geometry they lawfully occupy.

## 13.7 Authority Escalation as Unphysical Trajectory

Privilege escalation attempts to bend a worldline to intersect regions of spacetime for which it lacks charge. In CRE, this would require forging signatures or bypassing scope recognition—both detectable and non‑resonant.

---

## 13.8 Supply Chain and Law Injection

Introducing a transform is equivalent to introducing a new law of nature for future spacetime. Law injection therefore requires quorum authority and scope acceptance. A malicious law cannot retroactively rewrite physics; it can only govern regions of spacetime created after its lawful admission.

---

## 13.9 Side Channels and Causal Leakage

Side channels in classical systems exploit shared mutable resources and timing ambiguity. In CRE, timing is causal and shared resources are mediated by capability worldlines. Leakage would require unauthorized causal edges, which appear as explicit, auditable records.

---

## 13.10 The Membrane Attack Surface

Physical attacks—fault injection, power analysis, device compromise—attempt to introduce uncaused or misattributed events across the membrane. The membrane responds by:

* Recording anomalies as first‑class events.
* Attesting measurements and actuation.
* Branching when physical uncertainty introduces ambiguity.

No physical influence enters the causal graph without becoming a signed fact.

---

## 13.11 Denial of Service as Energy Saturation

Resource exhaustion is modeled as high field density and consumption contention. DoS is not invisibly catastrophic; it is an observable high‑energy state with measurable gradients. Mitigation is field rebalancing, priority shaping, and scope‑bounded throttling—thermodynamics, not firewall rules.

---

## 13.12 Economic Attacks

Sybil attacks, bribery, and manipulation are attempts to distort potential landscapes. With SigilID worldlines and vint‑denominated value, influence is conserved and provenance is explicit. Fake identities lack causal depth; purchased influence leaves a financial worldline.

---

## 13.13 Governance Attacks

Coup, capture, and censorship correspond to attempts to reshape constraint geometry by illegitimate law insertion or authority theft. Because all authority transitions are signed and causally ordered, such attempts are permanently visible and contestable.

---

## 13.14 Privacy and Surveillance

Surveillance is an interaction that extends light‑cones by observation. In CRE, observation is a record. Privacy is the control of which scopes and SigilIDs are authorized to create such records. Unauthorized observation is a non‑resonant interaction, detectable as an attempted law violation.

---

## 13.15 Faults, Bugs, and Exploits

Bugs are mis‑specified laws. Exploits are lawful but undesirable trajectories permitted by those laws. The remedy is not patching history but superseding law: introducing new transforms that constrain future spacetime.

---

## 13.16 Intrusion Detection as Topology Analysis

An intrusion is a causal path that should not exist. Detection is the identification of anomalous edges or densities in the causal graph. Forensics is graph traversal, not log correlation.

---

## 13.17 Formal Verification and Proof

Because transforms are declarative and deterministic, they admit formal proof. Safety properties become statements about unreachable regions of state space. An exploit is a proof that a region once thought unreachable is in fact accessible.

---

## 13.18 Resilience and Recovery

Compromise of embodiment does not compromise history. Keys may be revoked, capabilities rotated, and scopes reconfigured, but the causal past remains intact. Recovery is lawful continuation from a new authority configuration.

---

## 13.19 Deterrence by Physics

In a law‑bound universe, many attacks are not merely illegal; they are impossible. The cost of attempting to violate invariants is the cost of breaking cryptography or rewriting causal history—tasks whose difficulty is measurable and whose success would be universally observable.

---

## 13.20 Conclusion: Security as Conservation

Security in CRE is the preservation of invariants: of ancestry, of authority, of uniqueness, and of order. Adversaries may introduce hostile intent, but they cannot escape the geometry of the universe they inhabit. Every action leaves a trace, every trace has an author, and every author is bound by the same laws. Defense is therefore not an endless chase; it is the study and enforcement of physics. In a law‑bound universe, the safest systems are those whose security is not an overlay, but a consequence of reality itself.
