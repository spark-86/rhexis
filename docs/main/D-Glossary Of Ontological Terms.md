# Appendix D. Glossary of Ontological Terms

This glossary defines the core ontological vocabulary used throughout the Computational Reality Engine (CRE) text. Terms are given precise, physics‑like meanings grounded in causal records, cryptographic invariants, and Genesis Time.

## Terms

### Agency

The capacity of a SigilID worldline to select among admissible future branches by emitting signed records that collapse potential into fact.

### Ancestry

The immutable chain of parent records that causally precede a given record, provable by hash linkage and signatures.

### Authority

The scope‑bound causal reach of a SigilID; the set of transforms and resources it may lawfully influence.

### Branch

A divergent future region of spacetime arising from incompatible or alternative causal extensions from a common horizon.

### Canonical Timeline

The policy‑ or consensus‑designated branch whose future effects are admitted into shared reality.

### Capability

A conserved, cryptographically represented right to couple to a resource worldline or to invoke an HPC interaction.

### Causal Contract

The invariant relation declared by a transform: given certain parents, certain effects must exist.

### Causal Graph

The directed acyclic graph (DAG) formed by records and their ancestry, defining temporal order and admissible influence.

### Causal Time (Genesis Time)

The primary temporal dimension of CRE that orders events by provable ancestry rather than by local clocks.

### Consumption

The lawful annihilation of a record’s potential in the flux field, preventing reuse and enforcing uniqueness.

### Determinism

The property that identical initial conditions and laws yield identical causal extensions.

### Embodiment

The physical hosting of computation via the membrane and HPCs, binding cryptographic causality to material processes.

### Field (Flux)

The structured potential in which records, intents, observations, and consumptions interact via resonance with transforms.

### Fork

The creation of multiple lawful branches from a common horizon for counterfactual or parallel evolution.

### Horizon

A spacelike slice of the causal graph that fully determines all admissible futures beyond it.

### Identity (SigilID)

A persistent cryptographic worldline representing an agent, institution, or system, defined by signed causal continuity.

### Invariant

A property of record physics that cannot be violated without breaking cryptography or causality (e.g., ancestry, signature validity, uniqueness).

### Law (Transform)

An invariant interaction rule that must fire when its conditions are satisfied, producing new records.

### Light‑Cone

The region of spacetime that can causally influence or be influenced by a given record, defined by ancestry and scope.

### Membrane

The causal organ that hosts computation, enforces isolation, mediates HPC interaction, and preserves continuity across embodiment changes.

### Micromark

The smallest practical quantum of time accounting in CRE, used to express duration, deadlines, and temporal cost.

### Modal Analysis

Reasoning across branches to evaluate necessity, possibility, and counterfactual outcomes.

### Ontological Anchor

That which grounds existence in CRE; for agents, this is SigilID; for events, this is signed, time‑anchored records.

### Permanence

The property that records, once admitted, cannot be erased—only superseded—forming irreversible history.

### Provenance

The complete, verifiable ancestry and authorship of a record or resource worldline.

### Record

An immutable, signed, time‑anchored fact that participates in causality.

### Replay

The lawful re‑instantiation of spacetime from a horizon by re‑emitting identical causal descendants.

### Resonance

The condition under which a transform’s observes and consumes patterns match the flux field, compelling interaction.

### Scope

A jurisdictional region of causal space that defines authority recognition, policy, and isolation boundaries.

### Supersession

The introduction of a new record that constrains or contextualizes a prior one without erasing it.

### Thermodynamic Analogy

The treatment of governance, economics, and security as energy, potential, and equilibrium in causal fields.

### Timeline

A maximal, causally consistent sequence of records ordered by Genesis Time.

### Transform

See **Law**.

### Vint

The atomic, indivisible unit of ledger‑native economic value in CRE.

### Worldline

The continuous causal trajectory of an entity or resource through Genesis Time, formed by its signed records.
