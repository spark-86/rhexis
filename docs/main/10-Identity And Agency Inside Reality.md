# 10. Identity and Agency Inside Reality

## Abstract

In the Computational Reality Engine (CRE), identity is not an account, a username, or a row in a directory. It is an ontological anchor: a persistent worldline in causal spacetime, cryptographically bound and temporally continuous. SigilID names this anchor. Agents in CRE do not merely possess identities; they *are* identities extended through time by signed action. This chapter formalizes SigilID as a physical property of record existence and develops agency, authority, consent, and responsibility as consequences of causal geometry rather than social convention.

## 10.1 From Accounts to Worldlines

Traditional systems model identity as a handle: a mutable association between a name and a credential. Sessions come and go; accounts can be copied, reset, or deleted. The past can be obscured or reassigned.

CRE replaces this with worldlines. A SigilID is the cryptographic continuation of an entity through Genesis Time. Every signed record extends that line. There is no identity separate from its causal history.

---

## 10.2 What a SigilID Is

A SigilID is:

* A root cryptographic key (or key hierarchy),
* A causal lineage of signed records,
* A scope‑aware authority graph,
* A symbol that denotes a persistent locus of agency in spacetime.

It is not limited to humans. A SigilID may represent a person, a machine, an institution, a contract, a city, or a synthetic intelligence. Anything that can act and be held causally accountable may possess a SigilID.

---

## 10.3 Ontological Persistence

To persist in CRE is to continue to emit records signed by the same SigilID lineage. Key rotation, delegation, and revocation are not breaks in identity; they are internal deformations of the same worldline, recorded and provable.

Death, in this ontology, is the termination of further extension, not the erasure of past existence.

---

## 10.4 Authority as Causal Reach

Authority is the ability to lawfully introduce causes into certain regions of spacetime. A SigilID’s authority is defined by:

* The scopes in which it is recognized,
* The transforms it is permitted to trigger,
* The resources whose worldlines it may bind.

Authority is thus a geometric property: the size and shape of an identity’s future light‑cone.

---

## 10.5 Consent as Signed Causation

Consent is not a checkbox or a policy flag. It is a signed record that explicitly authorizes another SigilID to extend one’s causal reach or to couple worldlines. Delegation, contracts, and access grants are all instances of consent as physical event.

---

## 10.6 Action and Responsibility

Every action in CRE is a record. Every record is signed. Responsibility is therefore inescapable: to act is to inscribe one’s SigilID into the causal fabric. One cannot later deny authorship without violating cryptographic law.

---

## 10.7 Agency as Lawful Choice

Agency is the capacity to select among admissible future branches. The selection is realized by emitting a record that collapses potential into fact. Free will, in CRE, is not the suspension of causality; it is navigation within it.

---

## 10.8 Identity Across Embodiments

A SigilID is not bound to a single body or machine. Through the membrane and HPCs, an identity may inhabit multiple embodiments across time, migrating while preserving causal continuity. The body changes; the worldline remains.

---

## 10.9 Collective and Composite Identities

Groups, organizations, and protocols may possess composite SigilIDs formed by quorum signatures and multi‑key worldlines. Their agency is emergent from the lawful intersection of constituent identities.

---

## 10.10 Reputation and Memory

Reputation is not an external score; it is the visible structure of an identity’s past actions. Trust becomes a function of causal history, not narrative.

---

## 10.11 Anonymity and Pseudonymity

SigilIDs need not reveal physical or social identity. Pseudonymous worldlines can persist and act while remaining unlinkable to off‑chain persons, except by consent or lawful correlation.

---

## 10.12 Revocation and Death

An identity may be revoked in certain scopes, constraining its future light‑cone. This does not erase its past. Punishment becomes topological restriction, not deletion.

---

## 10.13 Moral and Legal Ontology

Because actions are permanent and attributable, ethics and law in CRE are grounded in physics. Judgment becomes traversal of causal chains; evidence becomes ancestry; intent becomes signed declaration.

---

## 10.14 Personhood Beyond Biology

Synthetic agents, autonomous collectives, and long‑running protocols may accumulate causal continuity and agency sufficient to be treated as persons within certain scopes. Personhood becomes an emergent property of worldline complexity and responsibility.

---

## 10.15 Identity and Economics

Ownership, obligation, and exchange are all relations between SigilID worldlines. Value flows along causal edges; debt and credit become conserved quantities in identity space.

---

## 10.16 Guardianship and Delegation

A SigilID may act on behalf of another through explicit delegation records. Guardianship is thus a lawful coupling of worldlines, bounded by scope and time.

---

## 10.17 The Self as a Causal Process

In CRE, the self is not a static object but a process: the ongoing extension of a worldline by choice and action. Memory is not psychological; it is literal causal persistence.

---

## 10.18 Recovery and Continuity After Compromise

If keys are lost or compromised, recovery is achieved by supersession and quorum attestation, preserving continuity while constraining future authority. Identity bends; it does not break.

---

## 10.19 Inter‑Universe Identity

Across branches, a SigilID shares a common past but diverging futures. Each branch carries a version of the same self, differentiated by the choices that collapsed potential into distinct histories.

---

## 10.20 Conclusion: To Be Is To Be Accountable

SigilID grounds identity in the same physics that grounds time and causality. To exist is to have a place in the record spacetime; to act is to extend a worldline; to consent is to sign a coupling; to be responsible is to be unable to erase one’s causal footprint. In the Computational Reality Engine, identity is not a label—it is a trajectory, and agency is the lawful shaping of that trajectory through choice made permanent.
